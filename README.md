Health checks for building services
===

Base on [Health checks for building services](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/HealthChecks), refactored to support NETCore 2.1 and NETStandard 2.0

This project is part of ASP.NET Core, as an initial out-of-band library and exploration of concepts and a way to get feedback.

The plan is to have a comparable library as part of ASP.NET Core vNext (probably, ASP.NET Core 2.2, but still TBD).

Check the [ASP.NETCore 2.2 roadmap](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).
